# Assignments and Feedback

<p>The work is the most important part of the process. The primary work in this course is completed via assignments. Each module will have assignments in the <strong>Engage</strong> section that are related to the objectives found in <strong>Warm Up</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Always check your assignments first!</strong> This way you know which assignments map to which objectives. Often times, your assignments will involve following along with the training content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>When are Assignments Due?</h3>
<p>Assignments are due before the start of the next week. The course moves fast and the work is intense. Every week moves on to a new topic building upon the previous. Your focus and attention should be on that week's topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Where's My Feedback?</h3>
<p>Feedback is part of the grading process. When you turn in your assignment, it will be graded and feedback will be given at that time. The feedback may come in the form of a comment, a video, a chat, or even a one on one meeting when necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since feedback is tied to grading of assignments, you won't miss out on valuable feedback if you have to miss a live session. Also, since feedback is tied to assignments, be sure to do your assignments!</p>
