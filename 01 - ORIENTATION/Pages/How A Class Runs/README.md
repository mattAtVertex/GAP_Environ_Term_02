# How A Class Runs

<h2>Anatomy of a Term 2 Class</h2>
<h3>The Philosophy: The Class vs The Learning vs The Work</h3>
<p>There are 3 parts to the course:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Class (live sessions)</li>
<li>The Learning (training content)</li>
<li>The Work (assignments)</li>
</ol>
<p>The mind tends to assign importance based on the chronological progression of how this is delivered. The reality is, that the order of importance is actually the opposite!</p>
<p>The single most important aspect of this course:</p>
<p><span><strong>The Work.</strong></span></p>
<p>Have you ever heard the term practice makes perfect? The only way to get good at something is to do it. You build skill like you do muscle.&nbsp; The class is there to motivate, the training content there to teach, but ultimately you will grow by doing the work.</p>

<h2>A Typical Week</h2>
<p>In Term 2, each sprint will consist of a significant amount of pre-recorded on-demand content. This is <strong>The Learning</strong> portion. It will start with ease in the first week and gradually ramp up over the course of the first few sprints. By the time you hit ENV202, you will have roughly 4 hours of content per week.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Each Sprint is equal to 1 week.&nbsp;</strong>Your week typically starts on Monday. You should check the assignments for the Sprint first thing at the beginning of the week.</p>
<p><strong>If you are at any point ahead</strong>, feel free to start the next sprint. <strong>Working ahead is encouraged and will only make you stronger</strong>.</p>
