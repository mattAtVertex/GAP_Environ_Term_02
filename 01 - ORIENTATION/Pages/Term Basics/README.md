# Term Basics

<h2>Primary Objective of Term 2</h2>
<p>The goal behind Term 2 is to teach you the technical skills you need to succeed as an environment artist. You'll get plenty of practice on techniques like working with Trim Sheets and the Mid Poly workflow, learn how ZBrush is different between environment artists and character artists, as well as important topics like composition and lighting.</p>
<p>You'll also get plenty of experience working in Unreal Engine and even learn some advanced material techniques along the way.</p>
<p>These skill sets are vital to have a grasp of for anyone wanting to go into the Game Industry or Virtual Production. Here in Term 2 you'll be building the muscle around these skill sets that will allow you to succeed on your capstone project in Term 3.</p>

<h2>Time Commitment</h2>
<p><strong>Minimum</strong>: 20+ hours per week</p>
<p><strong>Recommended</strong>: 30-40 hours per week</p>
<p>The most important aspect of the course is the work. To be successful, you will want to spend as much time as you can dedicated to doing the work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can I work full time while taking this course?</strong></p>
<p>It's not recommended, but we understand you have to do what you have to do. Remember to prioritize doing the work above all else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where should I divide my time?</strong></p>
<p>The bulk of your time should be spent doing the work (the assignments). The training material will show you how to do the work and the live sessions will be there to motivate you to do the work, but the primary focus will always be the work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I'm limited on time, how can I still succeed?</strong></p>
<p>Most of our training videos are hosted (unlisted) on YouTube. You can change the playback speed in settings. Watching the training content at 1.5x speed will reduce the time spent watching watching while still being consumable. Remember, the most important thing is doing the work. So you can watch it sped up, take notes, then get in there and just start working on the assignments.</p>
